# Part 1: Project Outline
**The Hair Loss Enigma: Cracking the Code in Your Mid-20s and 30s**

**Targeted Audience:** Individuals in their mid-20s to mid-30s experiencing hair loss or excessive shedding.

**Core Idea:** Facing unexpected hair loss in your prime can be confusing and frustrating. This project empowers you to demystify your hair loss by offering data-driven insights and personalized guidance.

**Visualizing the Trends:** Visualizations revealing how your unique blend of factors, from daily protein intake to stress level, influences your hair loss risk. Will translate complex data into captivating visuals.

**Raising Awareness**: Knowledge is power. This project won't just predict hair loss; it will **empower informed action**:

- **Early intervention:** Identify and address risk factors before noticeable hair loss,potentially mitigating its severity.
- **Personalized prevention:** Tailor your lifestyle and habits based on your unique data insights, promoting healthier hair.
- **Medical guidance:** Facilitate informed discussions with healthcare professionals for targeted interventions.

**Beyond Awareness:** By normalizing its diverse causes and promoting open dialogue, we can alleviate anxieties surrounding this common experience.

## The data
For my project, I will be utilizing the Hair Loss Dataset available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brijlaldhankour/hair-loss-dataset).

Attributes like total_protein, total_keratine, hair_texture, vitamin, manganese, iron, calcium, body_water_content (ranging from 0 to 100), stress_level, and liver_data serve as potential indicators. Total_protein and total_keratine represent essential elements for hair strength and growth, while vitamin, iron, and calcium levels contribute to overall health. Manganese supports enzymatic functions related to hair health, while body_water_content signifies hydration, crucial for hair vitality. Stress_level and liver_data act as factors affecting hair conditions. The target attribute, hair_fall, ranges from 0 to 5, representing varying degrees of hair loss intensity. This dataset, generated with 100000 entries, mimics real-world scenarios, encompassing diverse values for each attribute. Analyzing this dataset can facilitate predictive modeling to ascertain the correlation between these attributes and hair fall. Utilizing machine learning algorithms, this dataset enables the development of predictive models, aiding in understanding and foreseeing hair fall trends based on an individual's physiological and environmental attributes. Ultimately, such a dataset empowers the creation of models aimed at predicting and managing hair loss, potentially revolutionizing personalized hair care strategies.

## Method and medium
For collating the data and presenting the final output, I will primarily utilize Figma and Tableau. Figma offers versatile design capabilities, allowing for the creation of visually engaging data representations and dashboards. Meanwhile, Tableau provides powerful data visualization tools, enabling in-depth analysis and interactive visualization of the dataset. While I am considering Shorthand for its storytelling potential, I'm currently uncertain about its suitability for this project as I'm still exploring its possibilities.
