# About me
I am a MIIPS student at Integrated Innovation Institute-Carnegie Mellon University.

After completing my bachelor’s degree in Humanizing Technology Design in 2021, I spent the following two years designing solutions for LearningMate. I had to work cross-functionally with stakeholders in leading projects, instructional design, and digital product development as part of my job. As someone with a background in design, I consider my expertise in experience design, design research, and behavioral design.

I’m passionate about finding solutions to today’s design problems using design thinking. I am at ease working both solo and in a team while designing to make technology usable and accessible to users. I place a high value on critical thinking and creativity. I take pride in customizing what I produce to meet the particular requirements of each project. Which I would like to bring to your classroom and beyond.

# What I hope to learn
Create visualizations for different types of data using tools like Tableau. I want to be able to communicate insights with the help of visuals while doing data analysis.
