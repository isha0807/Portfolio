# 3 & 4: Critique by Design

## Step 1: Select a data visualisation from MakeoverMonday
For this assignment, I explored various visualizations available on Makeover Monday. My aim was to select a dataset that provided enough opportunities for experimentation and offered a more effective means of conveying the data compared to its original presentation. Ultimately, I decided to work with the data on **The cheapest countries to study in Europe in 2023**. This topic holds personal significance for me, as I myself was in the midst of selecting a university just a year ago. Engaging with this dataset took my down the memory lane and instantly resonating with me on a personal level.

## Step 2: Critique

Usefulness. 
6/10 
It effectively summarizes the main point of the article by showcasing the relative expense of different countries. However, for someone looking to make a decision based solely on this visualization, it lacks sufficient detail. To understand the specific numbers for each country, viewers would need to hover over each data point individually, which can be cumbersome.

Completeness.
5/10
It lacks clarity regarding the breakdown between the cost of living and the cost of education in each country, making it difficult for viewers to discern trends. While the accompanying article contains detailed textual information, relying solely on this can be time-consuming and overwhelming for viewers. Additionally, the main visualization only presents the average costs of the countries, leaving out potentially valuable insights.

Truthfulness. 
5/10 
The data can be easily misinterpreted based on the title alone. Nowhere does it explicitly state that the data is derived from the average of both tuition and living expenses. Initially, I mistakenly assumed it was solely based on tuition fees due to the lack of clarification.

Intuitiveness. 
10/10 
It's clear that hovering over the visualization will provide information about the countries.

Aesthetics. 
8/10 
The use of blue color in the visualization doesn't align well with the narrative. It creates an impression that certain destinations are more popular rather than simply more expensive. Additionally, countries with high costs should be visually highlighted to discourage selection. Utilizing cooler tones like grey or red would effectively convey this message, signaling that these destinations may be less desirable due to their high expenses.

Engagement. 
10/10 
With limited information in the initial data visualization, viewers are likely motivated to delve deeper into the article for additional insights. Consequently, the entire article becomes engaging for the audience as they are compelled to satisfy their curiosity and learn more.

## Step 3: Sketch out a solution
Reflecting on the previous critique I provided, it aided me in conceptualizing and sketching out the idea I aimed to communicate. The primary goal of the redesign was to clearly illustrate the breakdown of expenses, whether it be living or tuition costs, to empower viewers to make informed decisions.

## Step 4: Sketch out a solution
I tested the initial sketches with three participants: one male aged 30, and two females both aged 22.

Leveraged the following question to ask the users:
1. Show the initial data visualization and get the participants first impressions
2. Can you tell me what you think this is?
3. Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
4. Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
6. Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Feedback
Feedback:
1. Using a bar graph effectively presents all the data, enhancing the understanding of data points and assisting students or parents in making informed decisions.
2. Participants were curious about the reason behind the inverse relationship between high living expenses and lower tuition fees in some countries.
3. Despite this, participants appreciated the initial world map approach in the Data Visualization, as it provided a geographical context and allowed them to visualize how the average costs played out on a larger scale.

## Summing Up

I selected this visualization to offer viewers a comprehensive perspective. By highlighting countries with lower tuition fees despite high living expenses, students with budget constraints can identify affordable options. Moreover, those aspiring to study in cities renowned for excellent infrastructure and healthcare need not worry about exorbitant costs, as factors such as urbanization, government regulations, and taxes often mitigate tuition fees. Thus, while living expenses may be elevated, the overall average cost is moderated.

This way of analyzing visuals was really useful in my experience. It helped me to evaluate the same visualization from several perspectives, going beyond its beauty. As designers, we frequently focus primarily on aesthetics, but the criteria prompted me to investigate additional elements.While each phase provided distinct considerations, the whole experience was excellent. It taught me a fresh way to critique existing visuals and how to effectively incorporate other perspectives into the redesign process.
