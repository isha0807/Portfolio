# Wireframes / storyboards

### Shorthand Storyboard 

To create visualizations and storyboards for my project, I used Short hand, Tableau, and Flourish as my main tools. My storytelling concept was refined through developing wireframes and storyboards, and conducting user research with Shorthand.

# User research 
For the first round of feedback, I tested the shorthand storyboard with four participants of different ages and genders. Participants were Male (25 years), Male (34 years), Female (26 years), Female (32 years)

## Target audience

Many men and women in their 20s and 30s struggle with hair loss and its impact on their self-esteem. Hair loss can affect your mental health, your relationships, and your career. 
I selected participants who are experiencing hair loss and find it troubling, as they dedicate significant amount of time thinking about it. The individuals I chose spanned different age groups: two were in their mid-20s, and two were in their mid-30s. Additionally, I ensured diversity in gender representation, with two males and two females included.
